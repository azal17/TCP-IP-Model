**Assumptions Considered**

1. **Topology Flexibility:** The code is designed to accommodate different network topologies, including dedicated links and star topology. It assumes that the user can specify the desired network topology when setting up the simulation.

2. **Collision and Broadcast Domain Analysis:** The code includes functionality to analyze collision and broadcast domains in the network. It assumes that accurate mapping and calculation of these domains are essential for efficient network operation.

3. **Control Strategy Compatibility:** The implementation supports various flow control and access control strategies, including GBN ARQ, Aloha, Token passing, and Stop-and-Wait. It assumes compatibility and seamless integration of these strategies into the network simulation.

4. **Error Detection and Correction Reliability:** The error detection and correction mechanisms, such as Hamming code and CRC, are assumed to provide reliable transmission in the presence of errors. The code assumes accurate detection and correction of errors to ensure data integrity.

5. **Scalability:** The code is assumed to be scalable, capable of simulating networks with varying sizes and complexities. It should handle large-scale simulations without significant performance degradation or resource constraints.
